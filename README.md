# Heart_disease_prediction

* Trained the model using Artificial Neural Network on a dataset obtained from UCI-repo. Hyperparameter tuning was done manually to obtain the: Training Accuracy = 90% and Test Accuracy = 85%.
* The optimal hyperparameters obtained being: 1 layer, 400 units architecture; lr = 0.001; l2_lambda = 0.5; 20 Batches; BCELoss; Adam optim; 100 epochs
* Users can specify the values of 11 features (age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal) and get the prediction as result
